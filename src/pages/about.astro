      I started coding when I was 16 years old with a simple JAVA calculator for
      my high school project. Did not realise the power of programming until I
      started doing web development and participating in hackathons. I have been
      working on a lot of projects and hoping to monetise one such projects
      soon. I like the ideas of open source and decentralisation. You can read
      my blog to understand more about my thought process and my journey. Open
      to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me on
